        "Literacy is a foundational skill. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. When we fail to teach this foundational skill, people have fewer opportunities to lead the rich and interesting lives that a good education offers. This indicator measures the percentage of people aged 15 and older who can read and write a simple sentence about their daily life.",
        "Historical data shows that only a very small share of the population, a tiny elite, was able to read and write. Although literacy has increased over the last few generations, it remains an important challenge for our time to [provide this foundational skill to all](https://ourworldindata.org/better-learning).",
        "However, measuring literacy over time is difficult, as definitions of what it means to be “literate” have varied widely across countries and historical periods. As a result, comparisons should be made with caution.",
        "Our team investigated the strengths and shortcomings of the available data on literacy. Based on this work, we've combined historical and contemporary literacy rates from various sources to provide a long-term view of global literacy trends from 1451 to the present.

        "Many developed countries have discontinued literacy tracking as rates approached universal levels by the late 20th century, making measurement less relevant for policy purposes.",
        "All of this data measures basic literacy — can you read simple text and write your name? It doesn't capture *functional* literacy — can you understand a job application or follow written instructions? That requires years more education and is much harder to measure historically."

      "descriptionProcessing": "- This dataset combines historical and contemporary literacy rates from various sources to provide a long-term view of global literacy trends from 1451 to the present.\n- 1451–1800: Direct literacy surveys did not exist during this period. Data for Great Britain, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Poland comes from the \"[Charting the Rise of the West](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46544350_Charting_the_Rise_of_the_West_Manuscripts_and_Printed_Books_in_Europe_A_Long-Term_Perspective_from_the_Sixth_through_Eighteenth_Centuries)\" study. The authors estimated literacy rates using manuscript and book production as indirect indicators. While more books likely indicated more readers, this approach has clear limitations.\n- 1820–1970 (Global estimates): Estimates for worldwide literacy are drawn from the OECD's “[How Was Life? Global Wellbeing Since 1820](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/how-was-life_9789264214262-en.html)” report, which compiled a global long-run estimate of literacy using available historical records. A key limitation is that early literacy measures often accepted minimal skills — such as the ability to sign marriage documents — which fall short of contemporary literacy standards involving actual reading and writing proficiency.\n- 1900–1950: UNESCO's “[Progress of literacy in various countries](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000002898)” gathered data from 26 countries, revealing substantial variation in definitions. Some countries required only reading or writing skills, others demanded both, and some accepted signature ability as sufficient proof. Age thresholds also varied widely, ranging from 5 to 15 years.\n- 1950: UNESCO's “[World Illiteracy at Mid-Century](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000002930)” marked a significant milestone as the first comprehensive global literacy assessment. Data primarily came from censuses conducted between 1945 and 1954 for populations aged 15 and older. Where census data was unavailable, researchers generated estimates using historical trends and country-specific factors. Given the uncertainty, literacy rates were reported in 5% intervals. This data is reported as a range (e.g., 10–20%). These ranges were converted into single-point estimates by taking their midpoint to allow for consistent analysis. For example, 10–20% was recoded as 15%.\n- 1970–present: Contemporary data comes from the [UNESCO Institute for Statistics](https://databrowser.uis.unesco.org/resources/bulk), based on population censuses or household surveys, and is often self-reported. A person is considered literate if they can read and write a short, simple sentence about everyday life. Many countries also include basic numeracy in this definition. Rates are shown as the percentage of the population aged 15 and above who meet this threshold.\n- When only the illiteracy rate was reported, the literacy rate was calculated by subtracting it from 100%.",
